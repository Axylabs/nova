/**
 * Inbound routing — table-driven dispatch for app + control frames received
 * from a socket. Parses the envelope, enforces `maxMessageSize` + the inbound
 * allowlist, and routes to handlers / room operations.
 *
 * Decode is HEADER-FIRST: only the cheap envelope (version + event id) is
 * parsed before deciding what to do, so an event that isn't in the inbound
 * allowlist (or is a control frame) never pays the cost of a full `.unpack()`
 * payload decode — a client can't force us to fully materialize a frame we're
 * going to discard.
