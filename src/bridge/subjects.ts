/**
 * NATS subject naming for the ignex bridge.
 *
 * Every publish the server fans out to WS clients can ALSO be bridged to NATS
 * so other applications consume the exact same FlatBuffer wire frame. Subjects
 * are derived from the routing context:
 *
 *   - global publish            → `{prefix}.broadcast.{event}`
 *   - publishToTopic(topic,..)  → `{prefix}.topic.{topic}.{event}`
 *   - publishToGroup(group,..)  → `{prefix}.group.{group}.{event}`
 *
 * External apps push events INTO the hub by publishing on `{prefix}.inbound.>`
 * (the default inbound subscription; the server forwards them to all clients).
